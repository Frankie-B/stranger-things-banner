### Tasks

- **Attempt to recreate the "Stranger Things" animated banner ad**
  Using GSAP for animations, try to recreate a similar type of banner as created by MM for Netflix.

**Challenges**
The only real challenges I ran into were:

- The fireworks display, I used an animation created by someone else for this.
- not being able to figure out how to include a function call to be triggered in my timeline.
- For the second time the Netflix logo is shown, it looks to me like the splitText effect which is a paid plugin. I worked around this issue, but cropping the logo into two images, one with just the 'N' and the other 'ETFLIX' and animatined them seperately, to show jus the 'N' first and then the rest of the word.

I really enjoyed working on this and it is only the tip of the animation iceberg but was a lot of fun.
